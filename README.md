# COVID911_EmoMem

This is the github repo for our longitudinal Experiment examining the consistency of memory for a prolonged (COVID) and punctate (9/11) traumatic stressor.

This repository contains the code (work in progress); as of now, there are three folders containing code written primarily by Haoxue, Johnny, and a merged version of their code. 

If you have any questions, please contact Haoxue Fan (haoxue_fan@g.harvard.edu) or Johnny Castillo (jcastillo@g.harvard.edu).
